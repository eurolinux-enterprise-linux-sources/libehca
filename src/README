Introduction
============

libehca is a userspace driver for IBM InfiniBand HCAs (ehca).
It works as a plug-in module for libibverbs that allows programs
to use IBM InfiniBand HCAs hardware directly from userspace.
See the libibverbs package for more information.

Using libehca
==============

First the ib_ehca kernel module must be loaded for IBM InfiniBand
HCA devices to be detected and used. libehca will then be loaded
and used automatically by programs linked with libibverbs.
If applications want to utilize certain ehca's specific features
like xxx, yyy, they must be linked with libehca in addtion of
libibverbs.

libehca currently supports the following IBM InfiniBand HCAs:
- GX Dual-port 4x IB HCA
